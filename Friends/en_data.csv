372,50,10,Phoebe,You?re so sweet to wait with me.,5
373,50,11,Rachel,"Well, actually Gunther sent me. You?re not allowed to have cups out here, it?s a thing.",5
374,51,0,Ross,"And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all    that stuff is because he thought it was important to you.",5

391,52,5,Rachel,I mean I think I?d say no to anybody right now.,5
392,52,6,Rachel,"Oh, but it was so strange.",5
393,52,7,Rachel,"I mean I?m standing there with this charming, cute guy, who?s asking me to go out with him, which I?m allowed to do, and I felt guilty.",5
394,52,8,Rachel,"Y'know, like I?d be cheating on Ross or something.",5
395,52,9,Phoebe,"Wow. So, okay, maybe that means that, you?re not over Ross yet and you have issues with your father.",5
396,52,10,Rachel,I don?t have any issues with my Father.,5

409,53,11,Chandler,"Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours!",5
410,53,12,Chandler,If you were in a school yard you?d be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!,5

443,56,6,Ross,"Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'?",5
444,56,7,Ross,"Tell ya, you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!",5
445,56,8,Rachel,"Alright, that's it! Give it back! That's it!",5

455,57,8,Chandler,Y’know?,5
456,57,9,Chandler,"I was like, if I fall asleep  now I’ll get six hours sleep, but if I fall asleep now I’ll get five hours  sleep.",5
457,57,10,Chandler,Not matter what I did I couldn’t fall asleep.,5

478,59,5,Phoebe,That old jackass!,5
479,59,6,Rachel,Maybe Joey's right. Maybe all good deeds are selfish.,5
480,59,7,Chandler,"I'm sorry but, ow-owww-owww!",5
481,59,8,Monica,You've been lying to me? I can't believe you'd do that.,5

2165,182,6,Monica,Absolutely.,5
2166,182,7,Chandler,"Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know?",5
2167,182,8,Chandler,I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.,5
2168,182,9,Ross,"Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket.",5
2169,182,10,Chandler,"The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know?",5
2170,182,11,Chandler,"I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.",5
2171,182,12,Rachel,"Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian.",5

2179,183,5,Monica,We're not doing anything.,5
2180,183,6,Mr. Heckles,You're stomping. It's disturbing my birds.,5
2181,183,7,Rachel,You don't have birds.,5
2182,183,8,Ross,"Man, I sure miss Julie.",5
2183,183,9,Chandler,"Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie. Ok, yes, I see how you got there.",5
2184,183,10,Ross,You ever figure out what that thing's for?,5
2185,183,11,Chandler,"No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing.",5
2186,183,12,Chandler,"You know, I figure if I'm always answering the phone, people'll think I don't have a life.",5

2196,184,5,Chandler,"And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this.",5
2197,184,6,Monica,Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!,5
2198,184,7,Chandler,Monica,5
2199,184,8,Monica,"No-no, don't-don't-don't do it!",5
2200,184,9,Chandler,Will you marry me?,5
2201,184,10,Elizabeth,"No, go ahead.",5

2216,185,9,Joey,No!,5
2217,185,10,Joey,You gave me a pickup line!,5
2218,185,11,Joey,"As soon as I told her I wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first.",5
2219,185,12,Joey,"I suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her!",5
2220,185,13,Joey,And her roommate!,5
2221,185,14,Monica,What about the closeness?,5
2222,185,15,Joey,Closeness-shmoshness! There was three of us for crying out loud!,5

2237,186,14,Chandler,Did you like me when we first met?,5
2238,186,15,Rachel,"Chandler, I?m not gonna lie to ya, but I am gonna run away from you.",5
2239,187,0,Joey,"Come on C.H.E.E.S.E., I?m not leaving without you! Try routing your backup source through your primary CPU.",5

2258,188,4,Ross,"It was pretty funny when I, when I hid it for a while, huh?",5
2259,188,5,Ross,"Anyway, umm, I-I am worried about that bathing suit, not because it?s revealing which I?m fine with, no I?m concerned about your health, sun exposure.",5

2277,189,5,Ross,"How hot do I look in this, huh?!",5

2393,196,5,Joey,Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.,5

2396,196,8,Joey,"Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never played.",5

2421,197,14,Patron,I believed you were saving this seat for someone.,5
2422,197,15,Joey,"So, you?d hire me, right?",5
2423,197,16,Patron,For what?,5

2446,199,4,Chandler,I'm not very good at giving advice.,5

2552,205,7,Joey,So I had to do all this other stuff.,5
